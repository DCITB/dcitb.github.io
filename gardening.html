              How to build a Garden Box [11/3/18]
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>STEP 1</strong> Find a flat patch of dirt
              that gets plenty of sunshine. If the ground isn't
              flat, dig to level. The ideal size bed is 1200mm
              wide, 2400mm long and 400mm (or two sleepers) high;
              using 200mm x 50mm x 2400mm treated pine sleepers,
              which are ideal as they are resistant to rotting.
              Check your local Home Timber and Hardware for
              availability and alternative options.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>STEP 2</strong> Be sure to wear safety
              goggles, dust mask, gloves and hearing protection.
              Measure 400mm and cut 4 corner posts using the 90 x
              90mm treated pine posts. Measure 1200mm and cut the
              sleepers for the short ends of the bed to size. Every
              sleeper needs two bolts to secure it to each corner
              post. Mark and drill your screw holes. Attach them to
              the corner posts using 175 millimetre galvanised
              coach bolts and washers. Hammer the bolts through the
              hole, add a washer, then fasten with the nut. Using
              the same technique attach the long sleepers to the
              two end sections.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>STEP 3</strong> Use a heavy duty stapler, or
              a hammer and carpet tacks, to attach the weed mat to
              the top sleeper on one of the long sides. Unroll the
              mat to the other side, making sure it’s pressed up
              tight against the bottom corners, and staple into the
              opposing sleeper side. Overlap the rolls of weed
              matting by 100mm. Do the same from the short sides to
              ensure total weed cover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add a well-draining garden soil, and mix with organic
              animal manure and homemade compost. Fill the garden
              bed to around 30mm from the top. Now you can enjoy
              growing fabulous fresh vegetables.<br />

              Top 3 Tips and Tricks for the Garden! [13/3/18]
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Number 3: Water First!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a great idea to water your garden thoroughly
              before you put your mulch down. This wets the soil
              and the mulch keeps the moisture in. The best mulches
              are those with a variety of large and small
              particles, as this allows the oxygen and moisture to
              penetrate through to the plants’ roots. Even-sized
              mulches tend to compact and prevent oxygen and
              moisture penetrating the soil.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Number 2:Compact manure</strong> From
              personal experience, I have learnt not to use cow
              manure as mulch. The particles are small and they
              compact, making the manure water-resistant. Yes,
              water-resistant! So you end up with even drier soil.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Number 4: Heaps of spuds</strong> If you want
              to grow potatoes and don’t have a lot of room, get
              some chicken wire, make a big circle and use tomato
              stakes to secure it to the ground. Cover the seed
              potatoes with a mix of straw, old manure, blood and
              bone and compost, then water. As they grow, continue
              mounding the straw mix on top. Potatoes take about
              14–16 weeks to harvest and are ready when the plants
              begin to yellow and die back.
