              Why are people drawn to vegetarianism? Some just want
              to live longer, healthier lives. Others have made the
              switch to preserve Earthâ€™s natural resources or from
              a love of animals and an ethical opposition to eating
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to an abundance of scientific research that
              demonstrates the health and environmental benefits of
              a plant-based diet, even the federal government
              recommends that we consume most of our calories from
              grain products, vegetables and fruits.
            </p>
            <p>
              And no wonder: an estimated 70 percent of all
              diseases, including one-third of all cancers, are
              related to diet. A vegetarian diet reduces the risk
              of chronic degenerative diseases such as obesity,
              coronary artery disease, high blood pressure,
              diabetes and certain types of cancer including colon,
              breast, prostate, stomach, lung and oesophageal
              cancer.
